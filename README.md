# Introduction

    This application was designed with Bootstrap and React to operate as a creative web
    development blog. It was built using JavaScript and SCSS, and will consume an API
    also built with JavaScript and SCSS.

    In production, this application will showcase development projects completed by the 
    developer, as well as creative writing works. The blog will maintain at least two blog
    posts a week, and a new completed development project every two weeks.

    Any comments or constructive (optional) criticism will be seen quickest if they are
    routed through the Contact Us page. If the Contact Us page is the source of the 
    problem, then communication should continue on the Blue Fox Blog Facebook page. Link
    included in references. 

# Requirements
