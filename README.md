# Introduction

    This application was designed with Bootstrap and React to operate as a creative web
    development blog. It was built using JavaScript and SCSS, and will consume an API
    also built with JavaScript and SCSS.

    In production, this application will showcase development projects completed by the 
    developer, as well as creative writing works. The blog will maintain at least two blog
    posts a week, and a new completed development project every two weeks.

    Any comments or constructive (optional) criticism will be seen quickest if they are
    routed through the Contact Us page. If the Contact Us page is the source of the 
    problem, then communication should continue on the Blue Fox Blog Facebook page. Link
    included in references. 


# Requirements

# Installation

    To install this application to run from your machine, first make sure you have Node
    Package Manager installed. Then copy the repository link from the green Code button
    above the source files on github. On a terminal, navigate to an empty folder where
    you will keep the files. Run "git clone (paste link here)" and press enter.

    Afterwards, navigate into the project folder. Run npm install, and then npm start from
    the terminal. The application should open in a new window. If not, navigate to localhost:8080
